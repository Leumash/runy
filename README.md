# runy
runy is a simple shell script to make and execute a program.

## Usage
For easy usage, create an alias in .bashrc file:  
`alias runy=(File Directory)/runy.sh`

Then enter runy in the command line.

## Why
I've noticed that I create a bunch of small programs to test out the functionality of C++.

i.e.
`g++ -std=c++11 main.cc -o main`  
`main`

Now I can type:  
`runy`
